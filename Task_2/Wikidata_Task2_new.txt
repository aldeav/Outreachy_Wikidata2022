['''Note''': Issue with {{Q|Q59669028}} listed in the section 'Improvements and Edits']



=== Improvements and Edits ===
*Majority of the improvements made were related to gender, citizenship, etc and have been cross-checked with external source
s.
*Wherever required, references have been added.
<br>
There were a few issues that I faced while making the edits:
*While looking into {{Q|Q56875832}}, I tried adding the employer as {{Q|Q107517939}}, which is an instance of a facility, bu
t the property-value constraint specifies a list of values for this property and 'facility' isn't listed. For the time being
, I put in the employer as {{Q|Q107517939}} with the reference to his ORCID iD. I have also cross-checked with the official
website of {{Q|Q107517939}}. I'm still unsure if I should remove this or are we required to add 'facility' as a value for {{
P|P108}}.
*As I was working with the article {{Q|Q68818818}}, I realised that the first author 'Henry G. W.', which is defined as a {{
P|P2093}}, is {{Q|Q5607200}}. I added {{Q|Q5607200}} as an {{P|P50}} but I haven't added a {{P|P1545}} as I was perplexed by
 the difference between how the authors were stored on {{Q|Q68818818}} as opposed to the original article. The original arti
cle lists the first author as 'Gregory W. Henry', whereas it is stored as 'Henry G. W.' on Wikidata. Which of the following
would be the appropriate solutions to this issue:
::*Add {{P|P1545}} with {{Q|Q5607200}} and add {{P|P1932}} as 'Henry G. W.' to keep uniformity with how other authors are me
ntioned, even though it conflicts with the original article.
::*Edit the author names according to how they were stated in the original article and add the qualifier {{P|P1932}} with th
e string 'Gregory W. Henry' under the statement with {{P|P50}}.
*For the author {{Q|Q83401636}}, I created a new item {{Q|Q111531671}} to add the family name but the item does not contain
a lot of information as it does not seem like a common family name. Moreover, I could only find that {{Q|Q111531671}} is a f
eminine family name and Kislyakov is its masculine family name counterpart. Wikidata only has the item {{Q|Q101352}} and doe
s not give further categories of feminine and masculine family names (kindly correct me if I am wrong or have missed somethi
ng). Since I do not have any knowledge of the Russian language, I could not make further changes.
*While working on {{Q|Q29399013}}, I realised that {{Q|Q59669028}} was mentioned twice. Once as a string and then as an {{P|
P50}}. Since the original article stated 'J. M. Carpenter', I wanted to add this name to 'also known as' of {{Q|Q59669028}}.
 I also thought of changing the label of this item to 'John M. Carpenter', analogous to 'Gregory W. Henry', to accommodate t
he middle name (I am unsure if I can make this edit or is it better to let the label be John Carpenter). Nonetheless, no cha
nges could be made since {{Q|Q59669028}} is protected and cannot be edited. <br>
:For the time being, I have removed ‘J. M. Carpenter’ as a string and added {{P|P1932}}: ‘J. M. Carpenter’ to {{P|P50}}: {{Q
|Q59669028}}. Once my account is auto-confirmed, I’ll make the appropriate changes.



=== Bonus Task ===

In Wikidata, various statements are linked to an item that illustrates its characteristics. Statements comprise of property-
value pair. A property is a feature or a category and values are items or other attributes (such as numbers, strings, etc) t
hat correspond to a property. Taking the example of the item {{Q|Q58133639}}, for the property {{P|P735}} and {{P|P569}}, co
rresponding values are the item {{Q|Q676823}} and '29 August 1952', respectively. Values can also be links to external web p
ages. In addition, properties start with P followed by a number, and like items, they have their own pages. Furthermore, pro
perties have data types associated which specify the kind of values that are allowed in a statement with that property.

Qualifiers also consist of a property-value pair and further help describe the value of a property in a statement by providi
ng additional information. An example of the same is the property-value pair of {{P|P512}}: {{Q|Q752297}} under the statemen
t {{P|P69}}: {{Q|Q151510}} for {{Q|Q53986894}}.
